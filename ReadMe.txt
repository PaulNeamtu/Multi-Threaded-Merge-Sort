This is a test Java program that uses a Client and a Server to execute a multi-threaded sort. The client side creates a list of 100,000,000 random numbers that is then sorted between the client and the server. The server side will then print out how long the sort took in nanoseconds.

Each program must be run as seperate instances and the port number must be the same in order to connect to each other. The server must be run first. A message will print on both the server and the client to signify the connection.
